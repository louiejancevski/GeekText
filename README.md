## To run locally:

After cloning this repository, run ```npm install``` from the project root directory. 

Create a file and name it '.env', and make sure to put your own MongoDB database url inside a variable named 'DATABASE_URL'

Once set you can use `npm start` to run the app on your localhost, or `npm run dev` to use nodemon.

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop Nodejs based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. 

## About this project
This project was part of our Software Engineering I class at Florida International University, which took place in our Summer 2020 semester.

This is a course designed as a CS upper level course in which students learn how to develop a complex software engineering project by using agile software engineering principles.

Students work as a team with the Scrum framework to create a production level-software product that will is demoed at the end of the semester. 

In addition, the course covers traditional software engineering concepts such as system design with UML and testing principles.
